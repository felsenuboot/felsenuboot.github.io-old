      <h3>History & Values of van de Velde</h3>
      <p>
        Van de Velde (further also “the company”) is a public company located in
        Schellebelle, Belgium. The company was established by Achiel and
        Margaretha van de Velde in 1919. It celebrated its 100th anniversary
        recently. Van de Velde started off by only selling corsets on the
        Belgian market. It did not take long before they decided to do their
        first international step to the Netherlands. Dutch and Flemish customer
        demographics are relatively similar making the expansion easier. Van de
        Velde launched its first brand named “Marie Jo” in 1981. With the launch
        of the new brand van de Velde had clearly marked its new strategy. Along
        the way they would acquire more and more brands. Van de Velde was able
        to acquire the German company PrimaDonna in 1990. Its third brand Marie
        Jo L’Aventure was launched in 1997. The year also marked another
        milestone for van de Velde. The company went public with its Initial
        Public Offering (IPO) on the Brussels Stock Exchange. It went from being
        a privately owned family company to being a public company.
